# Graphics

Projects using OpenGL.  Here are the specifications of my work:

Window Management: GLFW
Extension Library: GLEW
Math Library: GLM
Texture Management: SOIL2

All of this source files in this dir branch in some way off the examples in the book "Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL using C++," by John Clevenger.  To run files, simply add or remove src files in the project.
